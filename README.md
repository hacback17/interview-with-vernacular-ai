### 1. Docker 

### To run the Dockerfile:
#### mdkir image1
#### cd image1
#### docker build .
#### docker run -it --name <custom-container-name> <image-id> bash


### 2. Auditing Hardware
#### My response to your eigth question: Networking - Network Firewall (Allowed Ports & Protocols), 
#### There is no way to reliably audit network firewall rules directly from a device behind the firewall. However, one could use Nmap to do so if reliability isn't a problem.
#### Otherwise, I have write a bash script to audit hardware with all the given points - sysaudit.sh


### 3. Managing Disk Space
#### All done! The bash script is available under the name of "managing-disk.sh"

#### Thanks for checking out my code. Any constructive feedback will be highly appreciated.
